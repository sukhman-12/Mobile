Web, hybrid, or native apps 
We've made the decision to create a native application for the given circumstance. The necessity to have access to native capabilities like the camera, GPS, and push notifications as well as a cohesive user experience on both the iOS and Android platforms are the driving forces behind this decision. 

UI Structure 
The following UI frameworks will be used for the native application: 

We'll utilize SwiftUI for iOS. 
We'll utilize Jetpack Compose for Android. 
Because each of these frameworks is created by the platform for which it is intended, native performance and the newest features are guaranteed. 

Backend programming language 
Because Node.js is user-friendly, has a large community, and has modules for developing RESTful APIs, we plan to use it for backend development. 

Authorizations 
In order to enable the necessary features for our application, we must ask for the following permissions: 

access to cameras 
GPS coordinates 
Notifications via push 
Internet connectivity 
When the user needs to access a certain functionality, only then will these permissions be requested. 

Data repository 
We'll utilize a combination of cloud and on-device storage for data storage. 

On-device storage: User-specific data, including offline data and app preferences and settings, will be stored on the device using SQLite. 
Cloud storage: To store user-generated material like posts, photos, and comments, we'll use firebase firestore or store user-generated content, such as posts, images, and comments.
Complementary architectures or technological stacks 
We'll make use of the following to provide effective and secure connection between the app and the backend: 

Authentication and authorization using JWT 
For API requests, Axios 
Push alerts with Firebase Cloud Messaging
